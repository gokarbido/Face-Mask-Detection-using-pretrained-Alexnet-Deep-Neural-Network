step1) Image Acquisition

in this code, images are captured using a digital camera upto 150 images
*First, you must set the camera option in matlab then we can go foward
for example:
if you use the prebuild webcam it will be cao=webcam(1);
else cao=webcam(2).

*Second, set a proper folder for keeping the specified datasets.

step2) Model training

*Use alexnet for training the datasets
*read the datasets folder(including subfolders)
*and after testing, it will produce .mat file which is required testing model

step3) Model Testing

*connect the camera again
*load the .mat file
*the code will detect the desired objects
